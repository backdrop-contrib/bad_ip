# Bad IP

This module checks the users accessing a site using the
[IP Intelligence](https://getipintel.net/) service and does not allow them to
create an account if the service reports the IP to be a proxy, VPN, or a bad IP.
Other operations could be slowed down or not allowed.


## Requirements

This module requires Backdrop 1.26.0, or higher version, and PHP 8.2.

Consult your server administrator or hosting provider if you are unsure about
these requirements.


## Installation

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  [Extend with Modules](https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/extend-with-modules).

- Visit the configuration page on admin/config/services/bad-ip and change the
  settings, at least to change the contact email that will be used to contact
  you when a problem arise or there are core changes. The other settings should
  be changed only if you are not using the free plan offered by IP Intelligence.
